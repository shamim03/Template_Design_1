					<h2> Tea production in Bangladesh </h2>
					<img src = "images/post-1.jpg" alt = "Admin's photo">
					<p> 
						Bangladesh is an important tea producing country. Its tea industry dates back to British rule, when the East India Company
						initiated the tea trade in Chittagong in 1840.[1] Today, the country has 162 commercial tea estates, including many of the
						world's largest working plantations.[2][3] The industry accounts for 3% of global tea production, and employs more than 4 million
						people.
						</br>
						The tea is grown in the northern and eastern districts, the highlands, temperate climate, humidity and heavy rainfall within these
						districts provide a favourable ground for the production of high-quality tea.

						Historically, Bengal was the terminus of the Tea Horse Road connecting the subcontinent with China's early tea-growing regions in
						Yunnan. Atisa is regarded as one of the earliest Bengali drinkers of tea.[5]
						Black tea cultivation was introduced in Bengal during the British Empire.[6] European traders established the first subcontinental
						tea gardens in the port city of Chittagong in 1890, when plantations were set up beside the Chittagong Club using Chinese tea 
						plants from the Calcutta Botanical Garden.[1][5] The first home-grown tea was made and tasted near the Karnaphuli River in Chittagong
						in 1843.[1][5] Commercial cultivation of tea began in the Mulnicherra Estate in Sylhet in 1857.[1] The Surma River Valley in the 
						Sylhet region emerged as the centre of tea cultivation in Eastern Bengal. Plantations also flourished in Lower Tippera (modern Comilla)
						and Panchagarh which in North Bengal.Panchagarh is the only third tea zone in Bangladesh and most demanded teas cultivated here.
						Tea was a major export of British Bengal. The Assam Bengal Railway served as a lifeline for the industry, transporting tea from growers
						in the Surma and Brahmaputra Valleys to exporters in the Port of Chittagong.[7][8]																		
						The Chittagong Tea Auction was established in 1949 by British and Australian traders. British companies such as James Finlay and Duncan
						Brothers once dominated the industry.[9] The Ispahani family also became a highly prominent player in the industry.
						Tea is the second largest export oriented cash crop of Bangladesh, following jute. The industry accounts for 1% of national GDP.[11] 
						Tea-producing districts include Maulvi Bazar, Habiganj, Sylhet, Chittagong, Panchagarh, Brahmanbaria, Rangamati[12]
						Once a major world exporter, Bangladesh is now a net importer of tea.[13] The rise of the Bangladeshi middle class has increasingly driven
						the industry to focus on a lucrative domestic market. The sector is today dominated by Bangladeshi conglomerates, including M. M. Ispahani
						Limited, Kazi & Kazi, the Transcom Group, James Finlay Bangladesh, the Orion Group, the Abul Khair Group and Duncan Brothers Bangladesh Limited.
						In 2012, Bangladesh recorded its highest production of tea, at 63.85 million kilograms.[14] The country has over 56,846 hectares of land under
						tea cultivation, up from 28,734 hectares in 1947.[1][2] The government has begun to promote small-scale tea growers, particularly in the Chittagong
						Hill Tracts.
						The price of Bangladesh tea is determined at the public auction in Chittagong. In March 2015, the international price of Bangladesh tea was US$2.40
