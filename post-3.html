					<h2> Cox's Bazar </h2>

						Cox's Bazar (Bengali: কক্সবাজার, pronounced [kɔksbadʒaɾ]) is a city, fishing port, tourism centre and district headquarters in
						southeastern Bangladesh. The beach in Cox's Bazar is sandy and has a gentle slope; with an unbroken length of 120 km (75 mi),
						it is the longest natural sea beach in the world.[2][3][4] It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the divisional headquarter of
						Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower". Another old name was
						"Palongkee".
						</br>
						The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company. Cox was appointed
						Superintendent of Palongkee outpost after Warren Hastings became Governor of Bengal. He embarked upon the task of rehabilitation
						and settlement of the Arakanese refugees in the area.[5] Captain Cox died in 1799 before he could finish his work. To commemorate
						his role in rehabilitation work, a market was established and named Cox's Bazar after him. Unlike many locations in the Indian
						Subcontinent where place names dating from the colonial period have been changed, Cox's name is still retained in the city he
						founded.
						Today, Cox's Bazar is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Bangladesh, although not a major international tourist
						destination. In 2013, the Bangladesh Government formed the Tourist Police unit to protect local and foreign tourists better,
						as well as to look after the nature and wildlife in the tourist spots of Cox's Bazar.

						Cox's Bazar Town was constituted in 1869, eventually becoming a B-grade municipality in 1989. Located along
						the Bay of Bengal in South Eastern Bangladesh, Cox's Bazar Town is a health resort. But it is famous mostly
						for its long natural sandy beach. The municipality covers an area of 6.85 km2 (2.64 sq mi) with 27 mahallas
						and 9 wards and has a population of 51,918.[7] Cox's Bazar is connected by road and air with Chittagong.[8]
						The greater Chittagong area, including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of Arakan kings from the early 9th century until its conquest
						 by the Mughals in 1666 AD.[9] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar
						 on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue
						 of one thousand palanquins stopped there for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," still exists
						 in the area. After the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese
						 and then the British.
						The name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India Company officer, Captain Hiram Cox, who was appointed
						 as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's Bazar) outpost. He succeeded Warren Hastings, who became the Governor of
						 Bengal following the British East India Company Act in 1773. The Captain rehabilitated many refugees in the area, but died
						 in 1799 before he could finish his work. To commemorate him, a market was established and named after him, called Cox's Bazar.
						 Cox's Bazar then was first established in 1854 and became a municipality in 1869.[9]
						After the Sepoy Mutiny (Indian Rebellion of 1857) in 1857, the British East India Company was highly criticised and 
						questioned on humanitarian grounds, specially for its opium trade monopoly over the Indian Sub-Continent. However, after
						 its dissolution on 1 January 1874, all of the company's assets including its Armed Forces were acquired by the British Crown.
						 After this historic take over, Cox's Bazar was declared a district of the Bengal Province under the British Crown.
